# CIS 515: Computer Graphics Labs

This repository contains all the lab assignments completed for **CIS 515: Computer Graphics** at the University of Michigan-Dearborn during the Fall 2024 semester. Each lab covers various aspects of computer graphics programming and implementation.

## Lab Assignments Overview

| Lab Number | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lab 1**  | Introduction to **NumPy** and basic **Image Processing** using OpenCV. Includes tasks on color segmentation and traffic sign detection. |
| **Lab 2**  | Basics of **PyGame** for creating simple windows, modifying background colors, and generating fractal shapes like the Sierpinski Triangle and Koch Snowflake. |
| **Lab 3**  | Measurement of execution time, controlling frame rates, and implementing **2D transformations** like scaling, rotation, and translations. |
| **Lab 4**  | **Pyrr-based transformations** and rendering 3D objects using the OBJ file format in PyOpenGL. |
| **Lab 5**  | Creating shaders in Python using OpenGL. Focus on writing vertex and fragment shaders to render 3D shapes with colors. |
| **Lab 6**  | Implementation of the **Phong Lighting Model** with tasks on ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting calculations and rendering spheres. |
| **Lab 7**  | Texture mapping techniques applied to 3D cubes, including tasks for mapping single and multiple textures. |
| **Lab 8**  | Adding text and image-based watermarks using the **Pillow** library. |
| **Lab 9**  | Building a basic **Neural Network** to classify the MNIST Fashion dataset and using the model to predict custom input images. |
